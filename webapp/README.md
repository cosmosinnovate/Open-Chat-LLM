# Chat Application

This is a chat application built with React.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

To run the React app, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `webapp` directory in your terminal:

   ```
   cd webapp
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Main Components

The main chat component is located in `src/views/MainChat.tsx`. This file contains the core functionality of the chat interface.

## Development

To make changes to the application:

1. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory to find the React components.
3. Make your changes to the relevant files.
4. The development server will automatically reload with your changes.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the app:

1. Run the build command:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. The optimized production files will be created in the `build` directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly by running `npm install` again.
2. Clear your browser cache and restart the development server.
3. Check the console in your web browser for any error messages.
